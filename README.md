## Natural Language Processing and Text Classification
This project makes use of NLP techniques to train models to predict different classes of angry comments. Data containing a group of different texts were then fed to the models to generate a prediction classifying the texts into their respective category of angry. Membership in one output category is independent of membership in any of the other classes. Meaning a comment may belong to any number of categories.
